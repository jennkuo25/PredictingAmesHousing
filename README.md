# PredictingAmesHousing

My goal here is to go through the workflow of preparing the data for training the model, and then to test a few different linear regression implementations. I hope you find this notebook helpful for exploration!

I've read through a few kernels on Kaggle for inspiration and insight, of which I'd like to highlight [Simple Linear Regression Models](https://www.kaggle.com/rbyron/simple-linear-regression-models) by Rocio Byron. She put together a great notebook with a clear framework.

## Outline:
1. Understand the problem and the data
2. Pre-processing (Data cleaning, normalizing the data, removing outliers) 
3. Feature Engineering
4. Train and Test
5. Compare Scores
